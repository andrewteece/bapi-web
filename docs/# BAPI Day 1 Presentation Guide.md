## ‚ùì Anticipated Questions & Prepared Answers

### "What's your first priority?"

**Answer**: _"WordPress audit and quick wins identification. I want to establish baseline performance metrics, identify immediate optimization opportunities that can show fast ROI, and ensure we have proper development environment access. This gives us early momentum while planning the longer-term headless migration."_

### "How long will the migration take?"

**Answer**: _"I've planned a 20-week phased approach. Weeks 1-4 are audit and planning, weeks 5-8 convert WordPress to headless, weeks 9-16 build the Next.js frontend, and weeks 17-20 are testing and deployment. Each phase has rollback options, so we maintain business continuity throughout."_

### "What about our existing workflows?"

**Answer**: _"B2B continuity is built into every phase of the migration strategy. I've specifically planned for preserving distributor pricing systems, technical product specifications, CAD download functionality, and bulk order processing. The goal is enhanced performance and maintainability without disrupting critical business processes."_

### "Can the team contribute to this documentation?"

**Answer**: _"Absolutely. I've set up multiple collaboration options - we can add team members as GitHub collaborators immediately, or if BAPI has a preferred GitHub organization, we can transfer everything there. The wiki system is designed for real-time team editing, meeting notes, and progress tracking."_

### "How do you know this will work?"

**Answer**: _"The strategy is based on industry best practices for headless WordPress migrations, specifically tailored to B2B e-commerce requirements. I've included comprehensive risk assessment, rollback procedures for each phase, and success metrics that are measurable. Plus, the competitive analysis shows this approach addresses real market opportunities."_

### "What do you need from us to be successful?"

**Answer**: _"WordPress admin access to begin the audit, introduction to key stakeholders in marketing and product teams for collaboration, and regular check-ins to ensure priorities align with business needs. Everything else is ready to go - I just need to understand BAPI's specific requirements and preferences."_
