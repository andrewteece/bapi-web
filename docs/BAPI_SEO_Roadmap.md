### 🚀 Next Steps
1. [ ] Commit this file as `/seo/roadmap.md` in the BAPI repo.  
2. [ ] Create a **keyword-map.csv** (Phase 2 data).  
3. [ ] Add a new “SEO” column in the GitHub Project for ongoing tracking.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Combine the long-tail strategy with the new headless architecture. Each dynamic product page should double as a content asset — complete with schema, alt text, related articles, and a “Learn More” CTA that links to a cluster page. This ensures BAPI’s catalog *and* content feed the same SEO ecosystem.
