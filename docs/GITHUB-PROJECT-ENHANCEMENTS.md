## How to Add These to Your GitHub Project Board

### Method 1: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/users/andrewteece/projects/7

3. Create each item as a "Draft issue"
4. Fill in the details using the information above
5. Set Priority, Area, Type, Estimate, and Target date
6. Add detailed descriptions for context

### Method 2: Bulk Creation Approach

1. Create all items first with basic titles

3. Set all the metadata (Priority, Area, etc.) in batch
4. Organize by Target date for chronological view

- **Area View**: Group by Area to see audit vs. standards vs. design work

## Integration with Your Existing Board

These new items will complement your existing structure:

**Pre-Start Items** → Lead into your existing "Developer Environment Audit" epic
**Week 1 Tactical Items** → Support your "Website Audit" and "30-Day Checkpoint" milestones

**Priority Distribution:**

- **P0 Items**: 5 items (critical path for first week success)
- **P1 Items**: 2 items (important but can be adjusted if needed)

**Timeline Flow:**

- Oct 1-5: Pre-start preparation
- Oct 6-10: Week 1 tactical execution
- Oct 24: Your existing 30-Day Checkpoint milestone

This creates a seamless bridge from your current preparation phase into active execution at BAPI.
