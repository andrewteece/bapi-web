- [Onboarding](docs/ONBOARDING.md)
- [Website Audit](docs/WEBSITE-AUDIT.md)

## Planned Tech

- Headless WordPress (WPGraphQL)
- Vercel + GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- **Node.js 20.x** (repo includes `.nvmrc` with `20`)
- Git

> Tip: If you use **nvm**, run `nvm use` in the repo to auto-select Node 20.

---

### Package Manager
We recommend **pnpm** for speed and monorepo readiness. Node 20 ships with **Corepack**, so you donâ€™t need a global install.

#### Use pnpm (recommended)
```bash
# ensure Node 20 is active
nvm use 20       # or install nvm and run `nvm install 20` then `nvm use`

# enable pnpm via Corepack (Node 20+)
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate

# install dependencies (after the app is initialized)
pnpm install

# start dev server (after the app is initialized)
pnpm dev
```

#### Or use npm
```bash
nvm use 20
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### Notes
- If `corepack` isnâ€™t found, run `npm i -g corepack` once.
- If you donâ€™t use nvm, install Node 20 from nodejs.org or with Volta, then skip the `nvm` commands.
- The repo is currently docs-first; once the Next.js app is initialized, `install` and `dev` scripts will be available.
